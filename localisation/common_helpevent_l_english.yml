 help_event.2.t:0 "Population System - Explanation"
 help_event.2.d:0 "§ODevelopment§! has been replaced by a Population system which splits development into 3 Population Classes.\n§OUpper Class§! - Which provides % modifiers, the most tax, but no manpower or land FL.\n§OCommoners§! - Which provides better economic modifiers than tribal, but half as much manpower.\n§OTribal§! - Which provides a lot of manpower, but lower economic benifit. Sometimes also called rural or lower class.\nThese will increase randomly based on current §OPopulation§! compared to §OPopulation Capacity§!, which can be seen by hovering over the province modifier in any province.\n§OPopulation Capacity§! is mostly gained through Buildings and Trade Power, but §OProvince Size§! (visible in the province modifier) also plays a major role.\n§OPopulation§! can §Gpromote§! from lower classes if growth rate is §Gpositive§!, or §Rdemote§! and §Rmigrate away§! if growth rate is §Rnegative§!.\n\nMore specific information can be found in provinces, and the extra options within this event."

 help_event.3.d:0 "Winning a siege of an enemy's city will fire an event in order to decide what to to. Availabilty of options depends on the situation: a simple regiment of 1.000 soldiers won't be enough to sack a big city! \nThere is now an §Mefficiency ratio§!: Army size £icon_manpower£, "Ferocity" or viciousness of the attackers £mil£ (base value is 5), and province's population ¤1 in thousands. Value capped at 100%. \nAs an example, if you are besieging a city of 15 development, to achieve 100% efficiency you'd need (X regiments) * 5 (ferocity) = 15*10 -> 30 thousand soldiers. \nEvery option below needs military power, obtains a sizable amount of §Oloot money§! (with the possibility of destroying buildings) and causes a given amount of §Rdevastation§! and §gpopulation lost§! or §Benslaved§!. \nThe maximum amount of population lost will be those over 60%/40%/20% minimum of tribals, commoners and upper population respectively. With the population to be enslaved, substracting all those who resist or can't be used, it's shared between §g%lost§! and §B%enslaved§!  \nOptions are as follows: \n - Ask Tribute:     5£mil£  §O20%§! / §R  5%§! / §g-§!   \n - Sack the city:   20£mil£  §O60%§! / §R 30%§! / §g-%§!   \n - Enslave (soft):  20£mil£  §O 5%§! / §R 10%§! / §g60%§!-§B40%§!   \n - Enslave (hard):  20£mil£  §O10%§! / §R 25%§! / §g20%§!-§B80%§!   \n - Destroy the city:  60£mil£ §O40%§! / §R 60%§! / §g60%§!-§B40%§!   \n - Delenda Est X:   100£mil£  §O100%§! / §R100%§! / §g80%§!-§B20%§!   \n - Leave them be: nothing   \n In the future there will be an option to §GLiberate§! their population if these are of your core, culture or other conditions."

 help_event.0.chi:0 "China Specific Info"
 help_event.7.t:0 "China"
 help_event.7.d:0 "In 612 BC, China is in the middle of the Spring and Autumn period. This era is characterized by tens of hundreds of "feudal" cities and statelets that became entirely independent after the fall of the Western Zhou dynasty. By this point in time, many states have already been taken over by their larger neighbors, and political reforms in the most powerful states have been well underway, which will eventually coalesce into the Warring States period."

 help_event.7.c:0 "ZhuXia (HRE) Info"
 help_event.71.t:0 "The ZhuXia"
 help_event.71.d:0 "The ZhuXia is used to represent the community of Chinese states that existed after the collapse of the Western Zhou dynasty in 771 BC. The leader of the ZhuXia is the BaZhu (Hegemon). After the Western Zhou collapsed, the Zhou court fled to ChengZhou and continued to exist, albeit only as nominal rulers of the whole realm; they only really controlled the capital city and surrounding lands. In 684 BC, Lord Huan of Qi was bestowed the title of Hegemon by the King of Zhou after his state had asserted itself as the undisputed power in the Central Plains (the important part of China in this time period). Beyond meaning the general kind of hegemony, this title also made Duke Huan the protector of the Zhou King and the Zhou Rites (the system by which affairs were conducted during the Western Zhou). Accordingly, Duke Huan not only asserted his own state's power - he also saved the states of Wey, Xing, and Yan from barbarian invasions, kept the state of Chu in check, and treated Zhou with respect. At the start of the game, Jin now holds this position. Historically, the Hegemony system would fall apart by about 500 BC.\n\nThe ZhuXia will automatically disband if there are §R23 or less§! states within it. However, that number is higher if a select number of states are large enough (For example, if there are less than 35 states, and at least three have 500 or more population, it will also disband). Once the ZhuXia disbands, you will enter the §YWarring States Period§!, giving you new reforms, the ability to declare yourself king, and eventually become emperor.\n\nAlternateively, you may opt to maintain the ZhuXia if you're the BaZhu, and attempt to centralize your power through the position of hegemon. Be warned that you will face opposition by going down this route, and you will §Rskip the Warring States period, missing out on the reforms therein§!. You may choose to centralize the ZhuXia and become emperor, or keep the ZhuXia decentralized, follow in Duke Huan's footsteps, and restore the old Zhou system (essentially giving you a vassal swarm)."
 help_event.72.t:0 "The ZhuXia (Continued)"
 help_event.72.d:0 "By the time you pass the reform §GBaZhu Conflict Intervention§!, the §GZhouLi Conference§! will begin. It may happen earlier if you enact previous reforms too quickly, and reach over 100 §RReform Desire§! The ZhouLi Conference will NOT occur if Zhou becomes the BaZhu. If they become BaZhu whilst the conference is ongoing, it will immediately end. The conference will also not occur if the ZhuXia is LiYue-BaDao.\n\nThe Zhouli Conference uses the Council of Trent mechanic. While the conference is ongoing, ZhuXia states may §Rdeclare themselves LiYue-BaDao§!, hurting your ZhuXia authority and hindering your reformation efforts. It is in your interest to finish the conference as quickly as possible, and to force and BaDao states back into the fold. If you are trying to become emperor through the ZhuXia reforms, note that LiYue-BaDao nations will §Ralways declare war on you§! once you enact §GUnited ZhuXia§!. You will also not be able to pass §GRebuild the Zhou World§! until there are no LiYue-BaDao nations over 100 development.\n\nPlease note that many of the features of the ZhuXia require the §GEmperor§! DLC."

 help_event.73.t:0 "Chinese Religions"
 help_event.73.d:0 "LiYue means the rites and traditions established by the Zhou dynasty circa 1046 BC, JiaoHua means respecting the Zhou as the true Kings of the realm. This differs from §GLiYue-BaDao§!, who took on the rites and customs of the Zhou, but do not respect the Zhou's position as King.\n\nAt the start of the game, most Chinese states are §GLiYue-JiaoHua§!, except for §GChu§!, who is openly defying the Zhou. §GQin§! may also join §GChu§! in their defiance, as they begin with §GWuism§! to represent their intermixing with the Rong peoples who migrated to the Guanzhong region that Qin now owns. §YLiYue-JiaoHua§! uses the Papacy mechanics from base EU4, called the Zhou court in IU. The controller of the Court is called the §GQingshi§! (high official). Lower officials are called §GZhou-Wang'DaFus§! (lit. Lower Officials of the Zhou King), and will increase a state's influence at court. Despite the loss of much of their de-facto power, the Zhou are still widely respected across China, and control of the court comes with a number of benefits.\n\nBy 253 AUC, new religions such as §GConfucianism§! and §GTaoism§! will spawn, however, they can only be adopted once the ZhuXia is dismantled. This is because the §GBaZhu§! is the leader of the Zhou-centric world, and would not allow new ideologies to be taken up so long as the position is relavent. It will automatically be dismantled if too little Chinese states exist. At that point, the §YWarring States Period§! begins.\n\n§YLiYue-BaDao§! and §YWuism§! both use cult mechanics, with §GLiYue-BaDao§! having some unique ones. §GConfucianism§! uses Muslim Piety mechanics, §YTaoism§! uses Japanese Isolationism mechanics, §GMohism§! uses Protestant church mechanics, and §GLegalism§! uses fervour mechanics. All Chinese religions also use the "Schools of Thought" mechanic - many schools are limited to the new religions."
 help_event.74.t:0 "Chinese Government Reforms"
 help_event.74.d:0 "Government Reforms in China work like a tier system. The first tier is Chinese Feudalism, the next is ShiQing, and the third is Political Reform Monarchy. The first two tiers will have a group of three types of reforms (administrative, economic, and military) that you will need to progress from left to right with, costing 50 Reform Progress after taking the first reform. Once you've reached the final reform in each catagory, you'll be able to advance to the next tier.\nPolitical Reform Monarch is different - it's meant to represent the rapid development that took place during the Warring States period. The buffs from these reforms are immense, but they're limited. After uniting China and completing all reforms within this tier, you'll get the Bureaucratic Monarchy reform. You also can't get Political Reform Monarchy until the Warring States occur."
 help_event.73.a:0 "What about Wuism?"
 help_event.75.t:0 "Wuism"
 help_event.75.d:0 "Wuism is not a part of the Chinese religion group, but is instead used mainly to represent the beliefs of non-Chinese groups located around the Zhou states, most of which were influenced by Shang religion. However, it is also used to represent "Shang holdouts", where the Zhou rites have not fully penetrated (like in the lands in the north of Qi and QiangGaoRu). Additionally, if you reform the Xia or Shang dynasties, you will get the option to convert to Wuism - in this case, it represents a revival of pre-Zhou beliefs.\n\nAs said before, Wuism uses cult mechanics, and some cults can be unlocked by fighting countries different culture groups. Two cults, those of Yu the Great and Di, are useable by the descendants of the Xia and Shang dynasties respectively if they are Wuist or convert to Wuism."
